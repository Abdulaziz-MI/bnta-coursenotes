# Capstone Project

In this project your group will design and build an application to solve one of the many issues facing a fictional company. In addition to the code you will also need to provide a business case for your proposed application, log and manage any associated risks, produce a project timeline and consider any ethical or regulatory issues which may arise.

You will be working in groups of 4-5 and have **two weeks** to work on this. You don't need to solve _every_ problem the company has, instead you should lean into your experience from previous projects to determine where you feel you can have the biggest impact. Remember that in this context learning and consolidation are more important than fixing the business' issues. On the final day you will present your work to your colleagues, instructors and clients.


## Key Timings

There are some key dates/times during this project:

- **Monday Week 1**:
	- Initial handout
	- Researching ideas

- **Tuesday Week 1**
	- Present business case to trainers
	- Start planning

- **Wednesday Week 1**
	- Trainers sign off plans

- **Thursday Week 2**
	- Submissions due at **3pm**

- **Friday Week 2**
	- Presentation practice
	- Self-reflection exercises
	- **2pm** presentations

These times are suggestions only, apart from the submission deadline and the presentation time. A member of the training team **must** sign off on your plans before you start coding. 


## Tech Stack

This is a full-stack project, meaning it must include both front and back ends. We recommend building a React app connecting to a Spring back-end to consolidate the work done so far on the course, but you can build on that by incorporating any additional functionality which you are interested in exploring and which is relevant to your app.

You are free to use any additional libraries as necessary (eg. for state management, CSS libraries) but only do so if everyone in the group understands what they are for, how they work and how they fit in to the overall picture.

Planning is still an important part of the process. Your plans **must** include:

- Wireframes
- Component diagrams
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Class diagrams
- A list of routes your API needs to provide
- A breakdown of your project into MVP and extension tasks

If you plan on using an external API in your projects make sure you can get all the information you need from it before you commit to using it. Likewise with any new libraries or code examples you find online. The trainers will be available to help throughout the two weeks but we'll likely be learning alongside you, so make sure you have taken the time to fully investigate everything so that you can explain your problem better.

## Project Management

### Preparing a Business Case

The first part of your planning will be the preparation of a business case for your proposed change. The scenario document describes a company in the process of digitising its processes and decentralising its infrastructure. In the document are some suggested problems which you may want to address but you are free to look at something not listed there if you can justify it.

We have provided a template for a short-form business case and an example of a completed one. This is sufficient for this project but in practice they can be significantly longer once verything has been considered. Your business plan needs to cover:

- A high-level summary of the problem and how you wil solve it
- A summary of the current situation and specific contributing factors
- Consideration of any constraints
- A list of requirements for your solution
- A summary of the expected benefits

It's not enough just to pick something and write a business case for it, you should also consider the impact it may have on other projects the business may be running or on other day-to-day processes. For example, an overhaul of HR systems may lead to issues with payroll or affect the development of a new scheduling tool. You should consider a [change management model](https://www.mindtools.com/ajm9l1e/lewins-change-management-model) as you make your decision.

It is also important to consider the company's IT infrastructure. Although their systems are relatively under-developed that doesn't necessarily make things easier. When planning how to implement your solution you should consider the infrastructure impact, for example the pros and cons of your system being a web app or of mobile-first design.

### Structure

You should follow the [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module) methodology while working on these projects. That means organising your time into sprints which can be as long or short as necessary - for a project of this length we suggest day-long sprints. Each sprint should begin with a discussion of what the team hopes to achive in that sprint and the allocation of work then end with a review of what was achieved during the sprint. The team should have regular stand-ups to check in with each other.

You should use a [Kanban board](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board) to help you manage your time. You can use a free service such as Trello or the built-in tools on GitHub. Even something like a Google Drive with live documents can be great to facilitate collaboration.

How tasks are assigned is up to each group. If you are working individually or in pairs **remember that communication is the most important tool you have** at your disposal and that many problems will be averted if the whole team has regular check-ins. 

A vital part of any Scrum process is the retrospective. These are similar to a sprint review in that they look back over recenet work, but while a review is concerned with the product a retrospective is instead looking at the process. These are opportunities to consider what has worked well and what could be improved going forward. Your group should decide at the start of the project when retrospectives will happen and record the outcome.

You can work on the project outside of normal working hours, but there is no expectation of this. It will be up to each group to decide on how to structure the week to ensure everyone is able to contribute effectively. Please don't be tempted to rush off and do extra work without keeping your colleagues in the loop, and also make sure you stick to any commitments you make. If unexpected issues start to arise, this is okay! Simply talk to your team and reorganise yourselves.

### Managing Risks

It is inevitable that _something_ will happen during the project which will affect your progress in an unforseen way. That something won't necessarily be bad (maybe someone has a breakthrough and finishes a task much quicker than anticipated?) but it will influence your timelines and need to be accounted for. You can do a lot to mitigate the effects though by considering any likely blockers before starting the project. For example:

- Does anyone in the group have another appointment they need to miss time for?
- Is anyone's internet connection likely to fail?
- Is the group attempting something complex which is likely to need external support?

These are examples of factors which represent a risk to your project and need to be considered. Your group will have its own which likely don't appear here.

Constructing a [risk register](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/guide-using-risk-register) will help manage risks which arise in your project. It is not a static document and should be updated as new risks arise, or old ones change in severity or relevance. We will provide a template containing some examples, your group should build on this as you work on the project.


### Communication

It is important to maintain good communication with all stakeholders in a project, although not all will require the same frequency or depth of update. Some examples of the different types of stakeholder can be found [here](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/project-management/who-is-project-stakeholder)

In this project your stakeholders are:

- Your team members
- The training team
- Clients attending the presentations

If this was a real project that list would include:

- Team leads
- Project managers
- Company management
- External contractors
- The company's clients

All need to be kept up to date, but not in the same way. For example, if a bug is discovered in the code the team definitely need to know but the trainers only need to know if their input is required to fix it. The clients definitely don't need to know. Tools such as [Mendelow's Matrix](https://www.professionalacademy.com/blogs/mendelows-matrix-marketing-theories/) will help you assess what level of communication is needed for each stakeholder.

For the purposes of this project we expect to hear from each group **at least** once after you start coding in addition to any bug-fixing. It is up to your group to decide the best format and frequency for updates.

### Handling problems

Once the coding starts it's inevitable that there will be bugs. Some of these will be relatively trivial and fixable immediately but others will be more involved and span code which multiple people have worked on. In these situations it is important that your group has some system for **bug tracking**. This could be as simple as a shared document listing problems but it is important to describe what the bug is, an estimate of how serious it is and the steps to reproduce it. For example:

- **Description:** Updating a user's details deletes the user from the database
- **Severity:** High
- **Steps to reproduce:**
	1. Make a `PATCH` request to `localhost:8080/users/:id`
	2. Make a `GET` request to the same url and receive a 500 error 

Your group should maintain a log of these bugs and if they were resolved or not. GitHub includes an issue tracking tool which you will be able to use from within your repository.

The training team will be available to help during working hours â€” please post questions in the cohort class channel and ensure that your issues are as descriptive as possible. 


## Submission & Presentation

You should create a **public** GitHub repository **before you start writing any code** and send the link to your trainers. It is up to you how to manage your branch structure, but we expect to see contributions from **every** member of the group. Make sure that the most up-to-date working version of your project is merged to the `main` branch ahead of your presentation.  

The project will culminate in a presentation to the rest of the cohort along with some invited guests from industry. Each group will have **10 minutes** to present their work, plus some time for questions from the audience. Your presentation should include:

- A discussion of your planning
- A demo of your app
- Discussion of some of the code. 
	- What were you particularly proud of? 
	- Were there any bugs you found really difficult to squash?

Please note that **everyone** on the team is expected to speak during the presentation.

Do not go through the code line by line, you won't have time. Avoid showing the editor during the presentation as jumping between files can be very confusing for the viewer and time-consuming for the presenter. Instead use a tool such as [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) or the [Polacode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode) extension for VSCode to generate screenshots of code you want to talk about and add them to your slides.

We recommend that a single person shares their screen and handles both the slides and the demonstration of the application.

There will be time following your presentations for a short Q&A session with the audience. Spend some time ahead of your presentation premeditating what questions may be asked and organise how you would like to answer these questions as a team. Please be aware of your other team members during this portion of the presentation and afford each other the chance to speak.

Following the presentation you will be sent a self reflection feedback form. As part of that self reflection we'll be looking for you to consider:

- How you worked as an individual within the team, what you achieved, and what could you have done to improve
- How you used the knowledge gained on the course to date to identify and solve the problem you've aimed to solve in your project
- How you would demonstrate that the team you worked in was professional, inclusive and fair

## Documentation

Every application needs good documentation to provide support for users. While some apps have their own distinct websites hosting their documentation for these projects it is sufficient to use the tools provided by GitHub.

Create a file called `README.md` at the top level of your directory structure and ensure that it is pushed to GitHub. GitHub will correctly format the markdown and display the content for us. Your README will provide enough detail about your project for anyone not involved with the team to be able to set it up and use it correctly. It should contain **at least**:

- A high-level description of the project's aims
- Links to **all** relevant documentation - business case, risk register, etc.
- The names and versions of any libraries used
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Links to any relevant diagrams such as ERDs or class diagrams
- A full list of example routes (or a link to one) including:
   - Full urls including placeholders for variables (`localhost:8080/users/:id`)
   - Permitted requests for each route (`GET`, `POST`, etc)
   - Examples of permitted requests where appropriate
   - Examples of responses 
   - Routes should be organised by route and not by request method
- Details of the project's MVP and any extensions covered, or a link to it 

This is not an exhaustive list; if there is something else you feel would be important for another developer to know about your application then include it here. There is no set format for a README but there are many examples such as [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) available online to give some guidance.

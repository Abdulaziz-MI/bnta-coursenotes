# Laptop Reset Instructions

Before you send back your laptop we need you to follow some steps to reset it for the next user. This will ensure that they don't have copies of your coursework or projects already on their system and give them a clean slate to work from.

1. Ensure any projects, practical exercises or files you have worked on during lessons are backed up. You can upload them to GitHub or copy them to an external storage device. If you use GitHub ensure that you don't have any repositories nested inside each other.

2. Sign out of any online services you have accessed using this laptop, eg. GitHub, personal email, etc.

3. Ensure you have logged out of your Apple iCloud account, if you logged in at any point.

4. Ensure you have backed up any job-related documents such as CVs.

5. Unpair any Bluetooth devices such as headphones or mice. To do this go to `System Preferences > Bluetooth` and click the cross next to the device in the list.

6. Follow the instructions for resetting your system [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212030).

	- Please note that there are slightly different reset instructions for whether you are using a macbook with an Apple Silicon or Intel processor. To check which you are in procession of, go to the top left of your Mac's toolbar, click the Apple icon and then select `About This Mac`. If you have an Intel processor, it will say as much, otherwise it will say "Apple M1"
	- **If you are in possession of a macbook with an Intel processor, please make sure to follow the instructions related to such which are pointed to at the top of the Apple Support page we have linked**

7. Re-install MacOS as per the last step in those instructions. **Do not complete the setup process!** The next user will complete this using their own information.
